# CyberSecurity and Privacy Event Resources

Inspired by [CryptoParty.in](https://cryptoparty.in), we've hosted a few beginner cybersecurity and privacy workshops. While there are many great resources for information on such things available all over the Internet, they are rarely organized into easily consumable, workshoppable nuggets. To that end, we've created this set of resources for anyone who would like to run such an event but would rather not put together their own material.

> *General Disclaimer: 100% security is not possible. Everything we do here is in an effort to move the goal post, to make it harder and less profitable for someone to get your private information.*

## How We Evaluate Tools

While we do recommend the usage of certain tools, apps, and services over others here, we are in no way affiliated with those we've recommended. We do not benefit when you download or sign up for these services. There are a number of guidelines we try to follow and attributes we look for to aid us in making these recommendations.

### End-to-End Encryption

Systems which use encryption schemes where only the communicating users can read the messages are prefered to those where the service provider has the ability to decrypt your information. If only you and the person you are communicating with have the ability to read your messages, the system is considered far more secure.

### Free or Open Source Software

Systems which are built on Free and Open Source software are preferred to those which are proprietary. Open source software is open for inspection generally by security experts. Though we do recognize that simply because something is open source doesn’t mean that it has been audited by experts. Generally speaking, though, we find we can more easily trust that which is reviewable over that which is completely out of sight.

### Federated Systems

Systems which are not owned or controlled by a single entity are prefered over those owned or controlled by a single company. For instance, email is a system where anyone can participate as a provider whereas FaceBook chat is 100% controlled by FaceBook. We present plenty of corporate controlled solutions here, but we consider this a good general rule.

### Convenience vs Security

Systems which strike a good balance between convenience and security. Convenience is forever at odds with security. When making systems more secure, it almost always comes at the cost of convenience. We make these trade offs because it’s the right thing to do. However, many modern solutions try to build in novel user experience to make up for the loss of convenience. We present solutions here that we feel present a fair balance between these poles. We’re happy to share more secure alternatives, if you’re looking to explore the deep end.

## Thread Modeling

Thread modeling is a procedure for optimizing security by identifying objectives and specific vulnerabilities. Security experts at companies and organizations create threat models to help them better protect specific assets. The existence of the concept is an admission that not everyone has the same security and privacy needs.

To that end, many of the tools presented in this guide may be unecessary for your particular situation. On the flip-side, what's presented here may not go nearly far enough, in which case you should seek specific security expertise to help you. Whatever the case, it's important for you to go through the excersise of identifing what assets you need to protect and from who. Bellow are some likely assets and attackers to consider when modeling your personal threat level.

#### Assets
* Personal information perhaps even made freely available on social media
* Financial information like credit card and bank account numbers
* Location information such as where you live, work, and spend free time
* Personal communications especially when centered on acts of resistence
* Business communications

#### Attackers
* Opportunistic hackers targeting credit card and personal information for identity theft
* Oppressive ex-partners or stalkers
* Oppressive government regimes hoping to silence dissent
* Business competitors seeking competitive advantage
